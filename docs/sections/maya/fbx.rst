Autodesk Maya and 3dsMax
=========================

Being Autodesk products, 3ds Max and Maya have the same workflow for
setting up animation takes for the FBX file. Both software packages use
the aptly-titled *Game Exporter* to achieve this.

In Maya, the Game Exporter is located in the **file** menu

Additionally, there are a couple of options in this menu for sending
directly to specific engines. More information is in the Autdesk
documentation.

Autodesk usually do this is you are working on the same machine to make
to export process a little more direct. But mostly, you will be sending
the export to another artist or developer, so the standard Game Exporter
workflow is usually better.
